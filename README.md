# Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis in SQL

**Data set** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022)

## Introduction
In today's dynamic economic landscape, payoffs represent a significant aspect of workforce dysnamics across various industries and regions. This project aims to look into a dataset titled layoffs, containing information on the number of people laid off across the world and within different companies and industries. The dataset consists of Tech layoff from COVID 2019 that is 11th March to April 2024. Through data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), I seek to gain valuable insights into the trends and patterns associated with layoffs.

## Objectives
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
   * After data cleaning process see (https://github.com/FaridahMut/Data-Cleaning-in-SQL) next step is to do EDA using SQL
   * Used different functions to get totals, order etc.
  
# Research questions
1. What is the overall trend of layoffs worldworld over the 3 years?
2. How do layoff vary across different comanies and industries?
3. Which are the top companies,e.g., top 5, in each year with the highest layoffs?
4. Are there any seasonal patterns in layoffs?

## Outcomes from the EDA
